A web-based interactive visualizer that demonstrates how different pathfinding algorithms work in real time. This project helps users understand how algorithms like A*, Dijkstra’s, BFS, and DFS explore paths on a grid.

🔍 Features
🎯 Visualizes popular algorithms:

Breadth-First Search (BFS)

🧱 Drag & drop walls to create obstacles

🏁 Set start and end points interactively

📊 Real-time animation of algorithm traversal and shortest path

🌐 Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript (or React, if applicable)

🔄 Reset and replay functionality
